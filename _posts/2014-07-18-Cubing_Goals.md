##TL;DR
Not only for shortreaders but also for those who read this post. I recommend you to have my new [Cubing Goal List)](http://tobip.ch/cubingGoals/client/) open, to see my Goals. In this Post I will go over each Event and explain the backgrounds of my Goals.

##3x3x3

3x3x3 is the main Event in the Cubing World. The 3x3 is also my main Event and because of that, I choosed high goals. When I started cubing in March my goal was to get under 20 seconds in 2014. At this moment I knew that I could do it, but secretly I thought that I'll never reach this goal. I thought, I'd rather put high goals, than low ones and then be dismotivitated.
And now, I'm around 20 seconds, in 1 to 2 month maybe constantly under 20 seconds. It's just amazing so this is my actual goal, to get as fast as possible under 20 seconds.
In my Cubing Goal Table there are several lower steps (lik sub17, sub15) but when I got 20 seconds my next higher target is to be the first person in Switzerland who gets an official Sub-10 Solve. Think I can do it in 2015.

##3x3x3 OH
Onehanded Solving looks just amazing, especially if you are fast. So I think Sub1m should be a good platform to get Sub40. For OH I have to learn several new algos to get faster, what's currently the most discouraging thing to give OH a higher priority.

##2x2x2

2x2x2... I don't like this event so much. Maybe it's because I don't have that good 2x2 cube or I'm just dismotivated to learn a fast method / alg-set like [CLL](http://www.brookscubing.com/cll.html). Maybe both. Nevertheless I want to become better because it's very nice to have as example a Sub-4 Average. But for that I have to learn CLL.

##4x4x4

I really like bigger cubes. Well, I currently only own the 4x4x4 but I planned to buy some bigger cubes later. Especially I like the fact that you can't solve the 4x4x4 in none time. I've you're one of the best of the world you even have around half a minute. That's cool I think. A higher challenge. You've to concentrate longer and also you must learn more steps. Thats why I love the 4x4x4. When I learned the Yau method properly (What I'm doing right now) I want to get Under 1 Minute. That would be very cool.

##Pyraminx

The Pyraminx is one of my most favourite puzzles. You can solve it very fast and you're really able to have make 1-Look solves (means you can just look at it at start and you're able to solve it). It also feels very cool to turn the Pyraminx fast. And I'm good at it. So good like I'm at no puzzle am. To be the Best in Switzerland is only a matter of time if I train enough and learn 1-Flip. Currently I can solve it very fast with the Beginners Keyhole Method. How fast will I am with 1-Flip? I hope to get Swiss Record!

##Conclusion
Yeah, that was about my Cubing Goals. I hope I can reach them all in the decided Time. I train an hour or more every day, so we will see. I'm obsessed :)

Thanks for Reading and a nice Day
