##TL;DR
Do you want a better Dropbox? This is exactly what [Seventy-Two](http://www.seventy-two.ch) is.
Easily Drag'n'Drop, Save, View, and shortlink your files. It's much more than worth to check it out!

##What is Seventy-Two
As I said above, it's simply a better temporary dropbox. The simplicity is a very big plus-point of this product. Without even signing up you can upload up to 1GB of files and get the link of it to share. Every File that you upload expires after 3 Days (72 hours, thats where the name comes from). There are two upgrade options which i will present you later.

##Plans
There are 3 different types. In the following graphic (which you also can find on the frontpage of [seveny-two.ch](http://www.seventy-two.ch)) you see all of them:

So if you are diamong you have all possibilites, no limitations.

##Options of a file upload
If you are a Basic User (Free Plan) you can't set any settings.

But let's have a look what it looks like, if you are diamond user:

You can set your own link (if it isn't already taken), set a password (which can be very useful), mark the file as direct downloadable (to implement it in websites (via link)) and you also can choose when the file should expire. You're totally free.

##Are there any other cool features?

**OF COURSE!**

###MP4 / GIF / other video formats...
Check this link: http://seventy-two.ch/f/beachocean

Seventy-Two displays video formats directly onsite. This allows you to watch videos directly online, you don't have to download it first.

Imagine this possibilities :D

###PNG / JPG / other image formats...
The same with images. All images will be beautifully displayed and if you click on them, they go fullscreen.

###Other Filetypes
The onsite display of other filetypes will follow each after another. The creators of seventy-two work very hard on it.


##Can we be excited about the feature?
And how!

Right now, the developement for a native seventy-two client (for Win and Mac) is going on very fast. It will not be long till the clients come out and I expect them to be masterpieces.
From what I heard from an insider, the client should support One-Press Uploads, with which is meant, you can click the Print-Screen Key and it will upload this Printscreen automatically on Seventy-Two.

Seventy-Two is in its beta and already an excellent Helper in the daily life of millions.


## Conclusion
For me, Seventy-Two is already a daily tool and I couldn't remember how I lived without it.

Thanks for Reading and a nice Day
